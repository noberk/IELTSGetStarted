two years ago I became very curious about the process of learning something new
deciding finally to sit down and learn that or in my case several thing that have been in the back of my mind for a long time now
how do we learn , how do we learn things quickly! how would do we learn
learn things in the way that allows us to go from knowing absolutely nothing 
about a skilll to being really good in very short period of time

 hopefully to have that process be as fun and exciting and not frustrating and not stressful 
 I decided to go to library and look up what cognitive psychology

we have thousands of distractions, we have 
the television and 
the internet and
social media and 
family members and 
frends and
all of the thins in our lives that make us so busy during the practice process
it's extremely important to make sure that you are not distracted by outside forces
turn of the TV block the internet close the door turn off your cell phone 
remove the distractions that can take your focus away from whatever this thing that you are trying to practice

a half an hour to 45 minutes a day to sit down and finally learn that thing you have always wanted to learn

chipping on the green
