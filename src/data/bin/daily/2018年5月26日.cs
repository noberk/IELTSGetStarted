How strange that such an excellent king should not take the chance I was offering him!
No European king would hesitate for a moment.
But he had other strange ideas. 
He believed, very simple, that every problem can be solved by honest,sensible people,
and that the political life of a country must have no secrets and must be open for all to see and understand.
Of course, we know that this is impossible , so perhaps his opinion of us is not worth considering.

ðŸ¦„Gulliver escapes from Brobdingnag 9

I was still hoping to return to England one day.
But the ship in which I had arrived in Brobdingnag was the first that had ever come near the coast.
So I could not see how I could get away. 
I began to think more and more about my family and my home.

By now  I had been in Brobdingnag for about two years. 
When the King and Queen travelle to the south coast,
Glumdalctitch and  i went with them. I really wanted to be close to the sea again,
which I had not seen or even smelt for so long
as Glumdalctitch was ill, I asked a young servant to take me down to the beach for some fresh air.
They boy carried me in my travelling box, and put me down on the beach,
while he looked for birds' eggs among the rocks.
I looked sadly at the sea , but stayed in my box,  and after a while I fell asleep.
I was woken suddenly when my box was lifted high in the air. 
I can only suppose that a largebird took hold of the ring on top of the box with his talons,
and flew away with it .
Through the windows I could see the sky and clouds passing by,
and I could hear the noise of the bird's wings. Then I was falling,
so fast that I felt quite breathless.
There was a loud crash,
as the box fell into the sea. Perhaps the bird had been attacked by others,
and so had to drop what he was carrying.
Luckly, the box had been well made, and not much sea water came in.
But I do not think any traveller has ever been in a worse situation
than I was then. I woudered how long I would survive,with no food or drink in the middle of the ocean.
I felt sure I would never see poor Glumdalctitch again
I knew how sad she would be to lose me.
