I have benn a train driver for 32 years
The vendors know when the train comes,
the station also announces via megaphone.
The Vendor will move thier goods
I only worry about tourists 
I have to observe and make sure there is nobody on the rail track

It's a typical Asian market
The stalls sit right on top of the tracks...
and fold away then the trains cut through.
I am not afraid. There are signs and an announcement from the megaphone.
Other have shelves on wheels.
They can move easily when the train comes
